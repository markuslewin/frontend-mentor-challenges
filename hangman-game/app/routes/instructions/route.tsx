			01
			Choose a category
			First, choose a word category, like animals or movies. 
			The computer then randomly selects a secret word from that 
			topic and shows you blanks for each letter of the word.

			02
			Guess letters
			Take turns guessing letters. The computer fills in the 
			relevant blank spaces if your guess is correct. If it's 
			wrong, you lose some health, which empties after eight 
			incorrect guesses.

			03
			Win or lose
			You win by guessing all the letters in the word before your 
			health runs out. If the health bar empties before you guess 
			the word, you lose. */}
